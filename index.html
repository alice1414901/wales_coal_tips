  <div class="step" data-step="0">Coal mining in Wales peaked in the early 20th century. In 1913, 57 million tonnes of coal were produced. Mining generated enormous amounts of waste, known as coal spoil, which was piled onto the hillsides surrounding the mines. Coal tips are these large man-made heaps of mining waste. Across Wales, there are 2574 of them. 
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="step" data-step="1">Coal tips can collapse or worsen flooding with poor drainage. However, not all tips carry the same level of risk. 360 are classified as Category  <span id="c">C</span> or <span id="d">D</span>, the highest risk classifications, meaning they pose a risk to human life or infrastructure.
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="step" data-step="2">Most of the most dangerous tips, 98%, are located in the South Wales valleys, where the former coal industry was concentrated. Many residents here are the children and grandchildren of miners.
    <div class="map-container"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="step" data-step="3">Rhondda Cynon Taf has 83 category C and D coal tips – more than any other local authority. In 2020, the collapse of a coal tip in Tylorstown, within Rhondda Cynon Taf, triggered a landslide, leading to the creation of a national coal tip register.

        <p>The Welsh parliament has set up a new authority to manage the coal tips, which will begin work in April 2027. For now, safety work continues under a patchwork of arrangements.</p>
        
        <p> Responsibility for coal tips is currently shared between different organisations. The Coal Tip Safety Taskforce was created in 2020 after the Tylorstown landslide by the Welsh and UK governments, to review the safety of tips. A Mining Remediation Authority produces inspection reports which go to councils. And Natural Resources Wales (NRW) can also help during risk assessments and safety work.</p>

      </div>
        <p>At present, it falls on councils to act on findings, although their powers of intervention are limited. Approaches vary widely: Rhondda Cynon Taf has a dedicated team for coal tips while other councils make coal tip safety a department’s responsibility. In Monmouthshire, an Assistant Engineer from the Flood Risk Management Team carries out coal tip safety work.</p>

        <p>Responsibility is further complicated by a variety of ownership patterns. </p>

        <div id="vis">
        <iframe title="The majority of coal tips in Wales are privately owned" aria-label="Donut Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XRYrp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XRYrp/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="100" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();</script>
      </div>
      <p>About half of disused coal tips have more than one owner, and several tips also sit across more than one local authority.</p>
      
      <p>Private landowners remain legally responsible for the safety of tips on their property. However the new Disused Tip Authority will be able to order safety work, and step in directly if owners fail to act, billing them for any completed works.</p>
      
      <p>While the power to compel safety action is welcomed by some, campaigners warn this could have unintended consequences.</p>
      
      <p>Daniel Therkelsen, a campaign manager and director at Coal Action Network, fears that the bill places more pressure on landowners to act, in a way that could encourage re-mining.</p>
      
      <p>“We suspect that these measures, which are expensive, are likely to make landowners more amenable to companies coming up and saying. Look don’t worry about the costs, we’ll mine these coal tips, and then we’ll remediate them afterwards, at no cost to you.”</p>

      <p>While new legislation at Westminster seeks to ban all coal licenses, mining coal tips does not require a license. This means that, for Therkelsen, “shortly after the bill is passed, coal tips will be the only place in the UK that you can legally mine coal.”</p>
      
      <p>“We’re afraid that this will turbo-charge the industry behind mining coal tips.”</p>
    
      <p>Therkelsen disagrees with that the idea that sometimes the only way to secure coal tips is to allow remining.</p>
      
      <p>“There is money to remediate coal tips, and money should come from Westminster, reflecting the historical responsibility that Westminster and England have to those [Welsh] coal tips. They benefited from the coal now they need to clean up their mess -- and they have the money to do it.”</p>
    
      <p>The cost of managing coal tips in Wales is estimated at around £600 million over the next 15 years. Funding currently comes from a mix of local authority budgets, ad hoc government grants, and project specific support. This year the Welsh Government allocated £34 million to 10 local authorities and NRW while the UK Government provided a further £25 million in the 2025 Autumn budget. </p>
    
      <p>However, Huw Irranca-Davies, Wales’s Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change and Rural Affairs said the limiting factor was not money, but a lack of staff.</p>
    
      <p>Similarly, the UK parliament heard in June that money alone doesn’t guarantee an effective monitoring system. </p>
    
      <p>Nicola Pearce from Neath Port Talbot Council told the Welsh Affairs Committee, “We just cannot get the staff to undertake the work on behalf of the local authority”. She explained that “they are either not willing to work for a local authority or there are no staff available in this geographical area.” </p>

      <p>Gareth Thomas is an ex-miner worked for 16 years at Maerdy Colliery in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Speaking about tip management, he said “I would say it’s almost non-existent. I’ve never seen teams inspecting tips until something happens.” </p>
      <p>Local authorities are the main organisations responsible for carrying out work on coal tips. </p>

      <p>In Caerphilly, Jim Davies Civil Engineering has recently been appointed for five years to carry out work. This includes clearing vegetation for inspections, adjusting slopes to improve stability and drainage, and installing material to prevent erosion and encourage vegetation growth.</p>
    
      <p>Caerphilly Council said the appointment has “helped support local jobs, by keeping skilled workers in the area, and providing training in specialist areas like coal tip maintenance and drainage. This type of contact provides steady work, which allows contractors to invest in local people and training.”</p>
    
      <p>However, councils acknowledge the difficulties of finding contractors with the necessary expertise, with Caerphilly Council’s Mark Williams saying that there were “not many of them on the market.”</p>
    
      <p>This scarcity is closely tied to the decline of the coal industry. As coal mining has largely stopped across Wales, the pool of engineers, hydrologists, and other specialists is increasingly small. Nicola Pearce said: “There are no training programmes to deal with the legacy of coal mining, apart from general engineering courses.” </p>

      <p>One response from the Welsh government involves Talent Beyond Borders, an organisation which matches skilled refugees with employers.</p>
    
      <p>Rabia Ceylan, a programme manager at Talent Beyond Borders, said it was working with the Welsh government to fill the skills gap. A similar scheme, Wales Asylum Seeker and Refugee Doctors, has seen 360 doctors and dentists placed in jobs across Wales.</p>
    
      <p>Regarding the coal tip safety programme, Ceylan said that no candidates have arrived in Wales, noting the process often takes a few years.</p>
    
    <p>Academics have also suggested that universities could help to fill the gap. Professors at the University of South Wales concluded in 2022 that the university was “well placed” to contribute to coal tip safety training.</p>
    
    <p>The university, which originally trained engineers and electricians for the coal industry, provides training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), drone mapping and 3D visualisation. This expertise was drawn upon in the initial assessment of the Tylorstown landslide in 2020.</p>
    
    <h2>Coal Tips and Biodiversity </h2>

    <p>Coal tip safety is a reminder of how the heavy industry which dominated the south Wales valleys continues to affect the area. But conservationists argue that coal tips have a unique value for species and habitat biodiversity.</p>

    <p>The tips are made up of coal dust, shale and ironstone. This means the soil is poor in nutrients and usually dominant plants such as bramble, bracken and grasses struggle to grow. Instead, a much wider range of plants species and the wildlife they support can coexist.</p>
    
    <p>Liam Olds, an entomologist and founder of the Colliery Spoils Biodiversity Initiative said, “nothing gets outcompeted; everything can live in harmony”.</p>
        <div class="img-cap">
      <img src="images/liam.jpg" alt="Liam Olds and his dog Sky" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption><i>Liam Olds and his dog Sky. Olds founded the Colliery Spoils Biodiversity Initiative in 2015.</i></figcaption>
  </div>
    <p>Many coal tips support what is known as “open mosaic habitats”, which include empty or sparsely covered surfaces mixed with areas of more dense vegetation. </p>
  
    <p>Such variation over a small area creates opportunities for different wildlife. Bare earth, often dismissed as “wasteland”, is important for things like ground nesting bees and wasps, hunting areas for tiger beetles and other nocturnal insects, and basking areas for reptiles such as adders.</p>
  
    <p>“In terms of what they deliver for nature conservation” Olds says, “it’s really big.”</p>
  
    <p>Olds believes every tip is unique. Some tips have a conical or ‘pyramid’ shape, while others are flatter with material deposited more evenly. Gelli Tips, located in Rhondda Cynon Taf “almost has a series of fingers and a really complicated shape”, a result of how extracted material was positioned on the hillside. </p>
          <div class="img-cap">
      <img src="images/gelli.jpg" alt="Gelli Coal tip covered with heather" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption><i>Gelli Coal Tip in Rhondda Cyon Taf.</i></figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>This affects what habitats can develop, and in turn which species each individual tip can support.</p>
  
    <p>The way extracted material was dumped also affects the pH of the environment, so within a tip both acidic and alkaline soils can co-exist. Chalky habitats are rare to find inland in south Wales, where acidic soils are more prominent. </p>
  
  <p>But coal tips can give rise to tufa springs, which form when calcium rich water seeps from the soil and deposits rocks made of calcium carbonate. This allows certain mosses to thrive, producing food and habitats for invertebrates such as solider flies.</p>
  
  <p>Olds warns that rare habitats such as tufa springs may disappear before their importance is recognised. </p>
  
  <p>“It’s a little habitat that gets missed quite easily – one of the issues is that if tips are going to be managed in a certain way, the habitat is going to get lost really easily because people don’t understand what tufa springs are”.</p>
    <div class="img-cap">
  <img class="vertical-img" src="images/tufa.jpg" alt="plant" class="nature-img" loading="lazy">
    <figcaption><i>A tufa spring. Minerals in the water form limestone deposits.</i></figcaption>
  </div>
  <p>“Even amongst ecologists a lot of them don’t understand brownfield sites very much.”</p>

  <p>Proponents of tip biodiversity would like to see greater protection. While some tips fall within Sites of Special Scientific Interest, this is often just because they overlap with already protected land. Some are recognised at a lower level as Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation.</p>

  <p>Olds is campaigning for more sites to be designated as Local Nature Reserves, giving them statutory protection and recognition from Welsh government.</p>
    <div class="img-cap">
  <img src="images/bell_heather.jpg" alt="Bell heather. Pink flowers" loading="lazy">
      <figcaption><i>Bell heather growing on a coal tip.</i></figcaption>
  </div>
  <p>Olds said that while coal tips were “meant to be a habitat that ministers try to protect, it’s probably one of those habitats which gets less protection than other priority landscapes such as woodland and heathland”. </p>

  <p>“Because they’re manmade, people just don’t value them, and there’s a lot of pressure to redevelop them.”</p>

  <p>Coal tips remain a deeply emotive topic in Wales. For many they are inseparable from the memory of the 1966 Aberfan disaster. As one resident from south Wales said, “you can’t talk about slag heaps without talking about Aberfan”.</p>

  <p>Olds acknowledges that coal tips have a reputational problem. “There is controversy about them, because you do have tips which are unstable, and people think of tips and think of Aberfan. We’ve been trying to change that perception a little bit even though it’s always going to be there.”</p>

<p>Through the Coal Spoil Connections programme, run with Natural Resources Wales and local communities, Olds and other conservationists are trying to change perspectives around coal tips by involving citizens. </p>

<p>The group runs free workshops and activities to connect people with their local coal tip by running free events. Past events have included a habitat management workshop and organised walks.</p>

<p>“Our work is trying to educate people about these sites and what’s special about them”. They’ve got a lot going for them – our job is to make people aware of that and make them think differently. You can come to these places, they’re not very dangerous, pretty beautiful and quite safe a lot of the time.”</p>

<p>Olds said the initiative has received a “very positive response” although financing it can be difficult because potential funders have never really understood the value in these sites.</p>

<p>This lack of understanding can lead to mismanagement of tips with tree planting or added topsoil, he says.</p>

<p>Olds says “with tree planting schemes what tends to happen is that they plant them incredibly close together in rows so the trees become very dense and unhealthy. There’s also the issue of using trees which are not local and can bring diseases.” </p>

<p>“I think sometimes they want to do tree planting because they think it will stabilise the soil and make the tips more stable, in doing so helping with public safety concerns. I’m a little bit sceptical of whether that really works and whether there is science behind it.” </p>

<p>Olds argues for a different approach: “If you want trees to establish it should be through natural means. Nature is far better at recovering land than we ever are. Allowing natural succession creates healthier, more diverse woodlands over time, without destroying the habitats that already exist.”</p>

    <p class="margin-bottom">This project was created by Alice Collyer as part of an MSc in Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University's school of Journalism, Media and Culture in August 2025.</p>
    <p class="margin-bottom">It uses d3 and scrollama to introduce the topic of coal tips. It then draws on interviews with various individuals and organsiations, FOIs, EIRs, and various other sources to explore themes related to new legislation, the skills gap in coal tip management, and the nature and biodiversity value of coal tips.</p>
