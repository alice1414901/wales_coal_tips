# wales_coal_tips
Dissertation project looking at the legacy of coal tips in Wales.

This project uses scrollama, d3 and visual storytelling methods to introduce the topic of coal tips. It includes a long form article which covers topics varying from the skills gap in coal tip safety, legislative developments, and the value of coal tips in terms of nature and biodiversity.

# Structure
The core of the project is contained in: 
- index.html
- style.css 
- script.js

The processed_data folder includes:
- Geographic_data_processing.ipynb
